Starting HERA program at HERA_main() ...

Just did two double-precision adds into R1/R2:
           R1 = 0x000f = 017 = 15
           R2 = 0x4240 = 041100 = 16960
Just did double-precision subtract into R7/R8:
           R7 = 0xfff0 = 0177760 = -16 = 65520
           R8 = 0xbdc0 = 0136700 = -16960 = 48576
The double-precision sum is 15 16960
The double-precision difference is -16 -16960

HERA program is done.

           r1 = 0xbdc0 = 0136700 = -16960 = 48576
