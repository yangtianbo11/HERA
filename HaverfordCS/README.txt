This git repository has the files for the HaverfordCS include files.

It should be cloned into the same folder in which you've cloned the specific C++ projects.

Students in CS245 should not normally need to edit it, and doing so could make you confront git merging.
So, we strongly recommend that you just view them and use "git pull" to get updates.
