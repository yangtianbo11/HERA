Status of keys in this project:

* Lab 2C: Dictionary-C++ has a working Dictionary class, complete with enhanced test-Dictionary.cpp;
      	  The calculator is mostly complete, and I've tested it some, though the "?" operation would
      	  not get full credit because it prints duplicates and also doesn't make sense to users who
	  aren't programmers.
	  
* Lab 2R: Dictionary-Racket similarly has a working dictionary and calculator except for "?";
      	  It also lacks any enhancements of the tests, though those from C++ could be added.
	  Note that it uses "define-contract" to check the validity of any dictionary before
	  building a non-trivial dictionary, and before printing, and also it has a dictionary
	  to provide one expression (rather than five) for the five operations +, -, *, ==, <=.
